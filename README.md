# SimpleCalc

SimpleCalc is a simple mathematical calculator addon for
World of Warcraft. It's a slash-based utility which allows
you to do maths!

Example usage and response:
`/calc 10415 - 9843 + 12`
> [SimpleCalc] 10415 - 9843 + 12 = 584

SimpleCalc works on equations left to right, so '10 * 3 + 2'
would be broken down into two sums: '10 * 3', then '30 + 2'.
Support for brackets is not yet in place, but this shouldn't
effect every day calculations.

Comments, suggestions and bug reports are most welcome!
